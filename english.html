Additionally, purchasing insurance is highly recommended, as it provides protection against potential damages and liabilities.</p>

<p>Driving in Los Cabos is generally safe, with well-maintained roads and clear signage. However, it's essential to remain cautious, especially when driving at night or in unfamiliar areas.
