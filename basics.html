        <h2>Included Mileage</h2>
        <p>Nowadays, most car rental companies in Mexico include unlimited mileage in their rental agreements. This provision allows customers to explore the country extensively without the concern of accumulating additional charges based on the distance traveled. Unlimited mileage can be especially beneficial for travelers planning to visit multiple destinations or take long road trips, providing the freedom to discover Mexico's diverse landscapes and attractions at their own pace.</p>

        <p>However, it is crucial for customers to confirm that unlimited mileage is indeed included in their specific rental contract to avoid unexpected costs. Some rental agreements may have restrictions or conditions that limit the included mileage, leading to additional fees if exceeded. To ensure a smooth and cost-effective rental experience, customers should carefully review the terms and conditions of their rental agreement and clarify any doubts with the rental company beforehand. Taking these precautions helps prevent surprises and allows for a more enjoyable and stress-free journey.</p>

        
        <h2>Requirements to Rent a Car in Mexico</h2>
        <p>The requirements to rent a car in Mexico are usually straightforward. Firstly, renters need to be older than 25 years of age, as this is a common age restriction imposed by most rental companies. Additionally, a valid driver's license is required; however, it does not need to be an international license. A license from your home country is generally acceptable as long as it is written in Latin characters and is not altered in any way.</p>

<p>Furthermore, renters must present a credit card at the time of rental. This is typically used to cover the rental charges and any potential damages or additional costs incurred during the rental period. Along with the credit card, a second form of identification, such as a passport or another official ID, is often required to complete the rental process. Ensuring you have these documents ready can facilitate a smooth and hassle-free rental experience.</p>

        
        <h2>Insurance Required</h2>
<p>By law, the only required insurance for renting a car in Mexico is third-party liability insurance. However, car rental companies will most likely require you to purchase additional insurance to cover possible theft and damages to the rental car. Although this insurance is theoretically optional, as customers could present their own policy, in reality, it is often obligatory. Most car rental brands will not accept personal policies or those bought from third-party providers, insisting that you purchase their insurance instead.</p>

<p>This necessity to pay for additional insurance is a significant reason why many customers end up paying much more than they originally budgeted. To avoid unexpected costs, it is advisable to prefer companies that include all necessary insurance in their rental prices. Alternatively, make sure to factor in the cost of this additional insurance when planning your budget. By doing so, you can ensure a smoother rental experience and avoid unpleasant surprises at the rental counter.</p>
